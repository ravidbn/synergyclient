# GitHub Workflow Build Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Dependencies ✅
**Problem:** The main.py imports KivyMD, requests, and uses Bluetooth functionality, but these dependencies were missing from both requirements.txt and buildozer.spec.

**Fix:** Updated both files to include:
- `kivymd` - Required for Material Design UI components
- `requests` - For HTTP requests
- `pybluez` - For Bluetooth functionality

### 2. JDK Version Conflicts ✅
**Problem:** Workflow was using JDK 17, but Buildozer typically requires JDK 8 for Android builds to avoid compatibility issues.

**Fix:** 
- Changed from JDK 17 to JDK 8 in the workflow
- Added proper JAVA_HOME environment variable setup
- Removed unnecessary JDK 17 setup step

### 3. Android SDK License Issues ✅
**Problem:** The SDK license acceptance command was using an incorrect path and method.

**Fix:** 
- Replaced `echo y | $ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin/sdkmanager --licenses` with direct license file creation
- Created proper license files in `$ANDROID_HOME/licenses/` directory
- Added all required license hashes

### 4. Problematic .gitmodules ✅
**Problem:** The .gitmodules file contained build artifacts and submodule references that shouldn't be in version control.

**Fix:**
- Added step to remove .gitmodules and .buildozer directory before build
- Created comprehensive .gitignore file to prevent build artifacts from being committed

### 5. System Dependencies ✅
**Problem:** Missing 32-bit libraries required for Android build tools, and `libtinfo5` package not available in newer Ubuntu versions.

**Fix:** Added missing dependencies:
- `libc6:i386`
- `libncurses5:i386`
- `libstdc++6:i386`
- `lib32z1`
- `libbz2-1.0:i386`
- Added fallback for `libtinfo5` → `libtinfo6` compatibility

### 6. Build Process Improvements ✅
**Problem:** Build process lacked proper dependency installation and verbose output.

**Fix:**
- Added `pip install -r requirements.txt` step
- Added `--verbose` flag to buildozer command for better debugging
- Proper environment variable setup for Android SDK

## Updated Files

### `.github/workflows/android.yml`
- Fixed JDK version (17 → 8)
- Fixed Android SDK license acceptance
- Added missing system dependencies with Ubuntu version compatibility
- Improved build process with verbose output
- Added cleanup steps to prevent submodule issues
- Added fallback for `libtinfo5` package (Ubuntu 22.04+ compatibility)

### `buildozer.spec`
- Added missing requirements: `kivymd,requests,pybluez`

### `requirements.txt`
- Added missing dependencies:
  ```
  kivymd
  requests
  pybluez
  ```

### `.gitignore` (New)
- Prevents build artifacts from being committed
- Excludes .buildozer/, bin/, dist/ directories
- Excludes .gitmodules to prevent submodule conflicts

## Testing the Fixed Workflow

### Automated Testing (Recommended)
1. Push these changes to your GitHub repository
2. The workflow will automatically trigger on push to main branch
3. Monitor the Actions tab in GitHub for build progress
4. Check build logs for any remaining issues

### Manual Testing (If needed)
```bash
# Local testing with the same environment
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y git zip unzip openjdk-8-jdk python3-pip autoconf libtool pkg-config zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libtinfo5 cmake libffi-dev libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 lib32z1 libbz2-1.0:i386

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install buildozer cython==0.29.33
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Clean previous builds
rm -rf .buildozer
rm -rf .gitmodules

# Build APK
buildozer android debug --verbose
```

## Expected Build Time
- **First build:** 20-40 minutes (downloads SDK, NDK, builds dependencies)
- **Subsequent builds:** 5-10 minutes (uses cached dependencies)

## Success Indicators
✅ All workflow steps complete without errors
✅ APK file is generated in `bin/` directory
✅ APK is uploaded as GitHub Actions artifact
✅ No "Unknown command/target android" errors
✅ No Java version conflicts
✅ No SDK license acceptance issues

## Troubleshooting

If build still fails, check the Actions logs for:
1. **Java version issues** - Ensure JDK 8 is being used
2. **Missing dependencies** - Verify all pip packages install successfully
3. **SDK/NDK download failures** - Network connectivity issues
4. **Permission errors** - Should be resolved with our fixes

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push all changes to trigger the workflow
2. Monitor the build in GitHub Actions
3. Download the generated APK artifact for testing
4. If successful, the build process should work consistently for future pushes
