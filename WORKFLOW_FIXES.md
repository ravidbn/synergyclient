# GitHub Workflow Build Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Dependencies ✅
**Problem:** The main.py imports KivyMD, requests, and uses Bluetooth functionality, but these dependencies were missing from both requirements.txt and buildozer.spec.

**Fix:** Updated both files to include:
- `kivymd` - Required for Material Design UI components
- `requests` - For HTTP requests

**Note:** Initially included `pybluez`, but removed due to compatibility issues with modern Python/setuptools versions. Android Bluetooth functionality uses Java APIs through PyJNIus instead.

### 2. JDK Version Management ✅
**Problem:** Complex Java version requirements:
- Android SDK tools (sdkmanager) require Java 17+ (class file version 61.0)
- Buildozer typically works better with Java 8
- `UnsupportedClassVersionError` when trying to run modern SDK tools with Java 8

**Fix:** Implemented dual Java version strategy:
- Use Java 17 for Android SDK setup and license acceptance
- Switch to Java 8 for the actual buildozer build process
- Proper JAVA_HOME switching between versions

### 3. Android SDK License Issues ✅
**Problem:** The SDK license acceptance command was using an incorrect path and method.

**Fix:** 
- Replaced `echo y | $ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin/sdkmanager --licenses` with direct license file creation
- Created proper license files in `$ANDROID_HOME/licenses/` directory
- Added all required license hashes

### 4. Problematic .gitmodules ✅
**Problem:** The .gitmodules file contained build artifacts and submodule references that shouldn't be in version control.

**Fix:**
- Added step to remove .gitmodules and .buildozer directory before build
- Created comprehensive .gitignore file to prevent build artifacts from being committed

### 5. System Dependencies & Package Compatibility ✅
**Problem:** Missing 32-bit libraries and package compatibility issues in newer Ubuntu versions (22.04+):
- `libtinfo5` package replaced with `libtinfo6`
- 32-bit packages not available without enabling i386 architecture
- Some packages have different names in newer Ubuntu versions

**Fix:** Added robust dependency installation:
- Added `dpkg --add-architecture i386` to enable 32-bit packages
- Made 32-bit packages optional (modern builds often don't need them)
- Added fallback for `libtinfo5` → `libtinfo6` compatibility
- Added missing autotools: `automake`, `m4`, `gettext`, `build-essential`
- Graceful degradation if packages are unavailable

### 6. Build Process Improvements ✅
**Problem:** Build process lacked proper dependency installation and verbose output.

**Fix:**
- Added `pip install -r requirements.txt` step
- Added `--verbose` flag to buildozer command for better debugging
- Proper environment variable setup for Android SDK

## Updated Files

### `.github/workflows/android.yml`
- Implemented dual Java version management (Java 17 for SDK, Java 8 for buildozer)
- Fixed Android SDK license acceptance with proper Java version
- Added complete build toolchain: autotools, automake, m4, gettext, build-essential
- Added robust system dependency installation with Ubuntu 22.04+ compatibility
- Enabled i386 architecture for 32-bit packages
- Made 32-bit packages optional for modern build compatibility
- Improved build process with verbose output
- Added cleanup steps to prevent submodule issues
- Added fallback for `libtinfo5` package (Ubuntu 22.04+ compatibility)

### `buildozer.spec`
- Added missing requirements: `kivymd,requests`

### `requirements.txt`
- Added missing dependencies:
  ```
  kivymd
  requests
  ```

**Note:** Removed `pybluez` due to `use_2to3 is invalid` error with modern setuptools. Android Bluetooth uses Java APIs.

### `.gitignore` (New)
- Prevents build artifacts from being committed
- Excludes .buildozer/, bin/, dist/ directories
- Excludes .gitmodules to prevent submodule conflicts

## Testing the Fixed Workflow

### Automated Testing (Recommended)
1. Push these changes to your GitHub repository
2. The workflow will automatically trigger on push to main branch
3. Monitor the Actions tab in GitHub for build progress
4. Check build logs for any remaining issues

### Manual Testing (If needed)
```bash
# Local testing with the same environment
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y git zip unzip openjdk-8-jdk python3-pip autoconf libtool pkg-config zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libtinfo5 cmake libffi-dev libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install -y libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 lib32z1 libbz2-1.0:i386

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install buildozer cython==0.29.33
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Clean previous builds
rm -rf .buildozer
rm -rf .gitmodules

# Build APK
buildozer android debug --verbose
```

## Expected Build Time
- **First build:** 20-40 minutes (downloads SDK, NDK, builds dependencies)
- **Subsequent builds:** 5-10 minutes (uses cached dependencies)

## Success Indicators
✅ All workflow steps complete without errors
✅ APK file is generated in `bin/` directory
✅ APK is uploaded as GitHub Actions artifact
✅ No "Unknown command/target android" errors
✅ No Java version conflicts
✅ No SDK license acceptance issues

## Troubleshooting

If build still fails, check the Actions logs for:
1. **Java version issues** - Ensure Java 17 is used for SDK setup, Java 8 for buildozer
2. **Missing dependencies** - Verify all pip packages install successfully
3. **SDK/NDK download failures** - Network connectivity issues
4. **Permission errors** - Should be resolved with our fixes
5. **UnsupportedClassVersionError** - Indicates wrong Java version for specific tools

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push all changes to trigger the workflow
2. Monitor the build in GitHub Actions
3. Download the generated APK artifact for testing
4. If successful, the build process should work consistently for future pushes
